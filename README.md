Projects from Bigquery Public Data combined with Python and SQL

We can access Bigquery public datasets from this link: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?fileType=bigQuery]

From the examples I am giving here, there is `key.json` credential to get access to google services and fetch data from Bigquery API. 
To obtain that service key, we can follow the steps given here: [https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started#create-service-account-console].

If you have questions, please let me know.
